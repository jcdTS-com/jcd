                JCD began her tutorial service during the summer of 2002 in Cebu City. Starting with tutoring a single elementary pupil, her clientele grew to four and then expanded further. On July 21, 2015, JCD took the step to register her small business with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). After 16 years of home-based tutoring, JCD Tutorial Services transitioned to a public commercial enterprise, officially opening on July 8, 2018. At present, JCD is registered in Australia.

                What I liked about my tutor Jan is that she treats me like a family member and teaches me like a parent would do. My academics are improving and she made me challenge myself into more complex questions during my times at the sessions. I would highly recommend her as an experienced teacher and she is a great example of how a tutor should deliver their service. She is perfect in tutoring which made me build up my resilience in my learning.

Thank you for the people behind JCD tutoring services. As Proverbs 22:6 says, "Train up a child in a way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it". God bless you always.

                Having teacher Jan as my tutor really helped me not just in my academics, but also helped me to be the independent and responsible person I am today. She makes studying and doing school works less tiring and boring. In my three years of having teacher Jan, she taught me vital study skills like time management and different strategies on how I study the content for my future exams, which I also apply in the present. That's why I'm really thankful to my mama for choosing teacher Jan to be my teacher because not only did I gain learnings, but I also gained fun memories and family.
